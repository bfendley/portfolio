      <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity. Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can
        only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplicifation usually does.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>

      <h3 class="headings">Questions</h3>

      <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML.</p>

      <h4 class="headings">Explaing the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute.</h4>

      <p>
        The "alt" attribute is used to provide a description of something, such as an image in a page if it does not load in correctly. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The "title" attribute is used to provide a description as well, but this shows up no matter what.  Not only as a back up like "alt".
      </p>

      <h4 class="headings">Please provide an example of how to mark up a definiton from the dictionary below</h4>

      <p>
        Using the definition element, you can define a term for later use. You can attach an anchor tag to the definition you want it to refer to throughout your content. For example, let's take a
        look at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML.</a>
      </p>

      <h4 class="headings">Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site</h4>

      <p>
        To link a site via a hyperlink one must use the "href" attribute with an "a" anchor tag. The anchor tag defines the hyperlink. The "href" attribute specifies the link's destination.</p>

      <p>
        Here's a working link to my favorite website:
        <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html" target="_blank" title="Good burger">Click Me</a>
      </p>

   <h3 class="headings">HTML DEFINED</h3>
      <dfn id="HTML-def"><mark>HTML</mark></dfn> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
