            <p><img class="img-style-1" src="assets/images/bfHeadshot.jpg"width="120" height="150">Hello, my name is Bryan Fendley. I am a student 
            at University of Arkansas at Little Rock and I am a part of the Spring 2021 class, I am also majoring in Information Science with a Minor in Management.After graduating with my degree, I look
            forward to continuing my career in automation and innovation of data management. With experience working both with small scale data management via keeping records for a lawn company,
			to working with the University of Arkansas Systems Office to integrate the states institutions with the WorkDay platform.  I believe my experience with managing any scale of data,
			along with automating tasks within the system makes me an ideal candidate in the data management field.  Specifically in the field of farming technology.  With a small town background and large network
			of farming associates, I am aware of the problems on the most essential workforce on the planet.  I plan on applying my knowledge of mass data management and integration to create more sustainable
			and consistent farming techniques.  To not only save the environment, but to improve the production and flow of food across the world in an attempt to eliminate hunger.
