            <p><img class="img-style-1" src="assets/images/bfHeadshot.jpg"width="120" height="150">Hello, my name is Bryan Fendley. I am a student 
            at University of Arkansas at Little Rock and I am a part of the Spring 2021 class, I am also majoring in Information Science with a Minor in Management.After graduating with my degree, I look
            forward to continuing my career in automation and innovation of data management. With experience working both with small scale data management via keeping records for a lawn company,
			to working with the University of Arkansas Systems Office to integrate the states institutions with the WorkDay platform.  I believe my experience with managing any scale of data,
			along with automating tasks within the system makes me an ideal candidate in the data management field.  Specifically in the field of farming technology.  With a small town background and large network
			of farming associates, I am aware of the problems on the most essential workforce on the planet.  I plan on applying my knowledge of mass data management and integration to create more sustainable
			and consistent farming techniques.  To not only save the environment, but to improve the production and flow of food across the world in an attempt to eliminate hunger.

                Was approached with a filing cabinet and an outdated desktop with .docx files in it.  I was tasked with 
                moving this data onto one platform so the workers could work faster, and get rid of the unorganized system as their company had outgrown it.
                I moved data from papers, and different text file types all onto spredsheets via google sheets.  This allowed them to syncronize their work without making contact with one another.
                This also allowed for one central location, so that the company could expand and hire new workers.  Rather than have the same customers memorized for life.
                I still keep up with these individuals for any tech advice they need.  I also installed a new desktop and office setting for them in their shop.</p>

            <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
            <p> Dear sir or madam,</p>
            <p>I am a young professional with over a year of experience working in data integrations, both on small and large scale projects.  I have always been interested in computers, 
            but realized that many around me came to me for support due to difficulty.  This lead me to pursue work in integration and automation, not to replace these workers, but to assist them.  Such
            as the automation and integration involved in the Workday application.
            These projects have sparked an extreme interest within me in terms of automation.</p>
            <p>We make many of these integrations to ensure ease to the users in the long run, automation is just another aspect of that. 
            I have experience designing and fleshing out an automated process.  I have been given a problem, drawn it, coded it, tested, and launched a process to completely solve this process.
            This skill finds itself intertwined with my interest for sustainable farming.  </p>
            <p>After working with these projects I realized that every person can benefit from integration and automation,
            it is not just the robots coming for us all.  I believe my end goal of creating an automated farming system to 
            prevent world hunger is a very cliche and larger than life problem, but I believe with the proper technology it can be done.
            Things like watering, ease of use of equipment for more jobs, data organization for less loss and more even spread of food.  This can all be done with technology.</p>
            <p>These job opportunities in my eyes are a way to amass my knowledge and potential team, as well as spread my ideas. 
            I love the work itself, no matter what I am doing with data.  I do know that there is more that can be done
            and with the right study and application testing, anything can be accomplished.  Especially with the correct knowledge and team being gathered through different projects.</p>
